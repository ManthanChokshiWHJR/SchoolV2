      <p class="text-muted">St. Xavier's School is no exception to this. But who is St. Xavier? We know that he was a holy man and has been proclaimed a saint and an example to follow. Perhaps we know vaguely that ha was a Jesuit Father, for so many Jesuit institutions are called “St. Xavier’s”. Perhaps also we think that he was the founder of the Jesuit Order,-which he was not, – and that he had some connection with India, which he certainly had.</p>
